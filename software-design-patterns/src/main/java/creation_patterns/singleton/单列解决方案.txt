Double-checked locking is the practice of checking a lazy-initialized object’s state
both before and after a synchronized block is entered to determine whether or not to initialize the object.
It does not work reliably in a platform-independent manner without additional synchronization for mutable
instances of anything other than float or int.

Using double-checked locking for the lazy initialization of any other type of primitive
or mutable object risks a second thread using an uninitialized or partially initialized member
while the first thread is still creating it, and crashing the program.

There are multiple ways to fix this
1. Not use double checked locking, and synchronize the whole method instead.
   With early versions of the JVM, synchronizing the whole method was generally advised against for performance reasons.
   But synchronized performance has improved a lot in newer JVMs, so this is now a preferred solution.
2. Use an inner static class to hold the reference instead.
   Inner static classes are guaranteed to load lazily.

TODO. 方案2 With inner static holder
